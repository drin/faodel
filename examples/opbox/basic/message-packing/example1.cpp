  //Message packing can be a pain in any communication package. Ultimately,
  //you want a convenient way to send information between nodes that takes
  //into account the fact that you need to put a sequential stream of bytes
  //on the wire and make sense of them on the other end. There are dozens of
  //ways to serialize/deserialize (serdes) messages, each with its own
  //tradeoffs in efficiency and user complexity. We've used boost, Cereal,
  //thrift, protocol buffers, XDR, and others, but don't have a go-to library
  //that works for all our scenarios. Sometimes we just want to put a POD
  //struct on the wire as fast as possible. Other times we just want an easy
  //way to serialize a complex c++ structure. In OpBox we don't force you to
  //serdes one way or another- you pick the approach that works best for you.
  //What we do instead is provide you with some helper functions to make it
  //easier to do common things.

  //At the lowest level, opbox works with plain, simple messages that all
  //have the same header. OpBox's message_t provides a pod struct with a header
  //that has common information Ops generally need: the source/destination ids
  //for both the node and mailbpx, n op_id for identifying the traffic this
  //message belongs to, a small user_flags section, and a body section for up
  //to 65535 bytes of data.

  //When you work with a message, you can work directly with it's POD:
  opbox::message_t msg;

  msg.src = opbox::GetMyID();
  msg.dst = opbox::GetMyID(); //Just a pretend value for now
  msg.src_mailbox = opbox::MAILBOX_UNSPECIFIED; //When we don't expect a reply
  msg.dst_mailbox = opbox::MAILBOX_UNSPECIFIED; //When this is a new message
  msg.op_id = 2112;   //Normally this would be the op::op_id value
  msg.user_flags = 1; //Ops almost always need a place to put flags
  msg.body_len = 0;   //No payload in this example

  //We can dump out the message's info
  cout <<"Size of header is "<<sizeof(opbox::message_t)<<" bytes\n"; //32B
  cout <<"Message is "<<msg.str()<<endl;

void example1_body_messages(){

  //Most ops need to send more than just a few status bits. OpBox's message_t
  //was designed to allow you to overlay larger message structures on top of
  //it and have it be usable by opbox calls. All you have to do is declare
  //a pod structure and place a message_t as the first item in the structure.
  //This effectively places all the extra sections in the body char array
  //of message_t.
  //
  // Caveat 1: You MUST update the header's body length with the size of
  //           the additional data (eg sizeof(new_message)-sizeof(message_t)
  // Caveat 2: This only works with plain-old-data types (PODs). Anything
  //           like a variable-length array, string, vector, etc, you'll
  //           need to pack yourself (see example1_complex_body_messages())

void example1_complex_body_messages(){

  //Sometimes an op needs to pack a few variable length fields and we don't
  //want to pay the price of a full-blown serialization library. We can
  //manually create these packed messages with some helper functions.
  //
  //In this example we want to send up to 16 different strings (of varying
  //length) in a message. We define a variable_message_t structure to
  //hold the message header, number of items, and lengths of each item.
  //The problem is that we don't know how big the message is until someone
  //gives us the data we need to put into it.
  //
  //The solution below uses a static Allocate function that allocates space
  //for the message based on user inputs, and then appends all of the strings
  //into the tail end of the message. We remove the default constructor to
  //prevent people from accidentally allocating messages without enough space,
  //and provide a getItem() function to the struct for extracting each
  //string from the packed data.
  //
  // Caveat 1: This level of manual packing is not for the faint of heart,
  //           and there are plenty of ways things can go wrong.
  // Caveat 2: It can be tricky to get deallocation to work correctly if
  //           you manually allocate the struct. If you allocate with something
  //           like reinterpret_cast<variable_message_t>(new char[len]), you
  //           may have trouble with delete vs delete[] in the destructor.
  //           using ::operator new(size) allows you to use the built-in
  //           destructor.
